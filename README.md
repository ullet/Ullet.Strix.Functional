# Ullet.Strix.Functional - Some C# Functional Code

A collection of C# functions, extension methods, and such.  
Mostly this is just my experiments with functional ideas in C#, but this code might conceivably be useful to someone else.  
If you are looking for a stable full-featured C# functional library then you're in the wrong place.
